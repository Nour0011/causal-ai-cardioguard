CAUSAL DISCOVERY REPORT
================================================================================

METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis combines multiple causal discovery approaches:

1. MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE DAG
   - Hand-crafted based on established medical literature
   - Represents decades of cardiovascular research
   - Forms the foundation of our causal model

2. PC ALGORITHM (Constraint-based)
   - Tests conditional independence relationships
   - Based on statistical tests (chi-square, G-test)
   - Good at finding causal structure from observational data

3. GES ALGORITHM (Score-based)
   - Searches for highest-scoring DAG using BIC
   - Greedy search with forward and backward phases
   - Balances model fit vs. complexity

4. NOTEARS ALGORITHM (Continuous optimization)
   - Formulates structure learning as continuous optimization
   - Uses smooth DAG constraint
   - Can handle larger graphs efficiently

5. CONSENSUS VOTING
   - Combines results from all data-driven methods
   - Keeps edges appearing in 2+ algorithms
   - More robust than any single method

6. HYBRID DAG
   - Merges medical knowledge with consensus
   - Ensures biological plausibility
   - Maintains DAG property (no cycles)

INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

The hybrid DAG represents our best understanding of causal relationships
affecting cardiovascular disease, combining:
- Established medical knowledge (gold standard)
- Data-driven discoveries (multiple algorithms)
- Consensus validation (robustness check)

This structure will be used for:
1. Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation
2. Bayesian Network construction
3. Personalized risk prediction
4. Intervention recommendation
